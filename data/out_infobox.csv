The bird is also known as the American mourning dove, the rain dove, and colloquially as the turtle dove, and was once known as the Carolina pigeon and Carolina turtledove.[2] It is one of the most abundant and widespread of all North American birds and a popular gamebird, with more than 20 million birds (up to 70 million in some years) shot annually in the U.S., both for sport and meat. Its ability to sustain its population under such pressure is due to its prolific breeding; in warm areas, one pair may raise up to six broods of two young each in a single year. The wings make an unusual whistling sound upon take-off and landing, a form of sonation. The bird is a strong flier, capable of speeds up to 88 km/h (55 mph).[3]",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Mourning_Dove_2006.jpg/220px-Mourning_Dove_2006.jpg,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mourning_dove

It is the ancestor to the domestic turkey, which was originally derived from a southern Mexican subspecies of wild turkey (not the related ocellated turkey). Although native to North America, the turkey probably got its name from the domesticated variety being imported to Britain in ships coming from the Levant via Spain. The British at the time therefore associated the wild turkey with the country Turkey and the name prevails.[2][3][4] An alternative theory posits that another bird, a guinea fowl native to Madagascar introduced to England by Turkish merchants, was the original source, and that the term was then transferred to the New World bird by English colonizers with knowledge of the previous species.[5]",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Wild_Turkey_%28female%29_-_Meleagris_gallopavo%2C_Occoquan_Bay_National_Wildlife_Refuge%2C_Woodbridge%2C_Virginia.jpg/220px-Wild_Turkey_%28female%29_-_Meleagris_gallopavo%2C_Occoquan_Bay_National_Wildlife_Refuge%2C_Woodbridge%2C_Virginia.jpg,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_turkey
